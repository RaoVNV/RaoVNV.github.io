Welcome to my education page! Below, you will find more information about each of the programs of study I have undertaken, and the advisors I have worked with.

# PhD in Educational Psychology (Statistics Education)

After being asked to redesign an introductory statistics course (GWU HSCI 2117; see my [teaching](/teaching.html/) for more), I sought to make evidence-based decisions and thus began searching the statistics education literature. This search quickly led me to [Dr. Joan Garfield](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/people/jbg/), [Dr. Robert delMas](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/people/delma001/) (Bob), and [Dr. Andrew Zieffler](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/people/zief0002/) (Andy) at the University of Minnesota. After meeting Bob, Andy, and some of their current and former students during a visit to Minneapolis, I decided to study [statistics education](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/topics/statistics-education/) under their direction. 

My early milestone work focused on psychometric analyses of the Comprehensive Assessment of Outcomes in Statistics (CAOS). I then shifted to studying students' understanding of statistical testing for my dissertation, especially their understanding of sampling distributions under a null hypothesis.

# MA in Educational Psychology (Learning and Cognition)

While earning my PhD, I began taking courses from faculty in the [Psychological Foundations of Education](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/programs/foundations/) program in the [Department of Educational Psychology](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/). At this time I also began working with Dr. Sashank Varma and [Dr. Jeffery Bye](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/people/jbye/) on two different projects, and participated in their lab. 

To improve my knowledge and skills in the cognitive and learning sciences, I began study under the direction of [Dr. David DeLiema](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/people/ddeliema/) and [Dr. Jeffery Bye](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/people/jbye/), focusing on courses such as Mathematical Cognition, Computational Thinking, and Advanced Cognition. 

<!-- The topic of my masters paper explored the cognitive foundations of probability underlying statistical reasoning and thinking. -->

# MS in Statistics

While working for the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/), I pursued an [MS in Statistics](https://statistics.columbian.gwu.edu/ms-statistics) from the [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/) part-time. My coursework primarily focused on modern data analysis and applied statistics, feature courses such as Data Mining, Legal Statistics, and Modern Theory of Sample Surveys. 

I worked on some small projects with [Dr. Joseph L.  Gastwirth](https://home.gwu.edu/~jlgast/) and [Dr. Rida Moustafa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rida-moustafa-a663971a7/), but due to competing priorities from my job (and given that I was not, at that time, considering an academic career), I never presenting this work at conferences or produced manuscripts.
