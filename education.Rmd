Welcome to my `Education` page! Below, you will find more information about each of the programs of study I have undertaken, and the advisors I have worked with.

# PhD in Educational Psychology 

Program: Quantitative Methods in Education // Concentration: Statistics Education

After being asked to redesign an introductory statistics course (GWU HSCI 2117; see my [teaching](/teaching.html/) for more), I sought to make evidence-based decisions and thus began searching the statistics education literature. This search quickly led me to [Dr. Joan Garfield](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/people/jbg/), [Dr. Robert delMas](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/people/delma001/) (Bob), and [Dr. Andrew Zieffler](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/people/zief0002/) (Andy) at the University of Minnesota. After meeting Bob, Andy, and some of their then current students during a visit to Minneapolis, I decided to study [statistics education](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/topics/statistics-education/) under their direction. 

My early milestone work focused on psychometric analyses of the Comprehensive Assessment of Outcomes in Statistics (CAOS). I then shifted to studying students' statistical thinking for my dissertation, especially their understanding of null models.

# MA in Educational Psychology

Program: Psychological Foundations of Education // Concentration: Learning and Cognition

While earning my PhD, I began taking courses from faculty in the [Psychological Foundations of Education](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/programs/foundations/) program in the [Department of Educational Psychology](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/), focusing on courses such as Mathematical Cognition, Computational Thinking, and Advanced Cognition. 

I soon began working with [Dr. Sashank Varma](https://psychology.gatech.edu/sashank-varma) and [Dr. Jeffery Bye](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/people/jbye/) on projects at the intersection of mathematical cognition and statistics education. I also began working with [Dr. David DeLiema](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/people/ddeliema/) on projects at the intersection of the learning sciences and statistics education (see my [research](https://raovnv.github.io/research.html) for more). 

My masters paper explored the cognitive foundations of probability underlying statistical reasoning and thinking, specifically in the processing, encoding, and retrieval of semantic and numerical information when presented as *p*-values.

# MS in Statistics

While working for the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/), I pursued an [MS in Statistics](https://statistics.columbian.gwu.edu/ms-statistics) from the [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/) as a part-time student. My coursework primarily focused on modern data analysis and applied statistics, featuring courses such as Data Mining, Modern Theory of Sample Surveys, and Legal Statistics. 

As a student, I primarily worked on projects in legal statistics with [Dr. Joseph L.  Gastwirth](https://statistics.columbian.gwu.edu/joseph-gastwirth) and projects in data mining with [Dr. Rida Moustafa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rida-moustafa-a663971a7/).

# BS in Mathematics

Concentration: Pure Mathematics // Second Major: Economics // Minor: Spanish

Even as a young child I always loved numbers and mathematics came easy. As an undergraduate student, I fell in love with theoretical mathematics. I particularly loved taking Abstract Algebra and Number Theory.

Along the way I also picked up a double major in Economics, spent some time as pre-med (and obtained an EMT-B and CPR Instructor license along the way), and also minored in Spanish (and spent a summer in Granada, Spain).
