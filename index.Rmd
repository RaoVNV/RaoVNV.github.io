Hello! My name is V.N. Vimal Rao. I am a Statistician and Educational Psychologist, currently at the [Department of Educational Psychology](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/) at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). 

My main interests are in the psychology of statistics: what does it mean to *do* statistics, and how does one learn to do statistics? Specifically, I study [statistics education](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/topics/statistics-education/) with [Robert delMas](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/people/delma001/) and [Andrew Zieffler](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/people/zief0002/). I also study [learning and cognition](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/programs/foundations/learning/), as it relates to statistical reasoning and thinking, with [Jeffrey Bye](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/people/jbye/) and [David DeLiema](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/people/ddeliema/).

On this website, you'll find more information about me, my education and work experience, as well as my teaching and research projects. 

Thank you for visiting my webpage!
