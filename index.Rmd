Hello! My name is V.N. Vimal Rao. I am a Statistician and Educational Psychologist, currently at the [Department of Educational Psychology](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/) at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). 

My main interests are in the psychology of statistics: what does it mean to *do* statistics, and how does one *learn to do* statistics? 

On this website, you'll find more information about me, my education and work experience, as well as my teaching and research projects. 

Thank you for visiting my webpage!
