Hello! My name is V.N. Vimal Rao. I am a Statistician and Educational Psychologist, currently at the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). 

My main interests are in the psychology of statistics: what does it mean to *do* statistics, and how does one *learn to do* statistics? 

On this website, you'll find more information about me, my education and work experience, as well as my teaching and research projects. 

Thank you for visiting my webpage! You can contact me on Twitter or via Email using the links in the top right of the page.
