Hello! My name is V.N. Vimal Rao. I am currently a PhD candidate in [Educational Psychology](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/) at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), where I study [statistics education research](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/topics/statistics-education/) under the direction of my advisors, [Robert delMas](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/people/delma001/) and [Andrew Zieffler](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/people/zief0002/). 

I am also about to begin concurrently pursuing an MA under the direction of [David DeLiema](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/people/ddeliema/) and [Jeffrey Bye](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/people/jbye/) focused on the study of [learning and cognition](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/programs/foundations/learning/), as it relates to statistical reasoning and thinking. 

On this website, you'll find more information about me, my education and work experience, as well as my teaching and research projects.
