<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Work Experience</h1>

</div>


<p>Welcome to my work experience page! Below, you will find details about each of the full time jobs I’ve held.</p>
<div id="chief-of-data-management-and-analysis" class="section level1">
<h1>Chief of Data Management and Analysis</h1>
<p>HIV/AIDS Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration – July 12, 2015 to Dec 27, 2016</p>
<p>I served as an innovative leader in data management and analysis. I supervised a team of 8 FTEs and 2 interns in the provision of consultation, advice, and leadership for data collection, data processing and quality evaluations, advanced database management, and data analysis and dissemination. Voluntary separation. My final performance management appraisal program (PMAP) rating of ‘Achieved Outstanding Results’.</p>
<p>Main Duties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supervise the collection of programmatic data for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program via the Ryan White Services Report, AIDS Drug Assistance Program Data Report, Dental Reimbursement Program, Community Based Dental Partnership Program, AIDS Education and Training Center Data Report, as well as programmatic grant allocation and expenditure reports</li>
<li>Manage contracts with an approximate annual budget of $6 Million to assist in the development and implementation of data collection systems and processes on behalf of the HIV/AIDS Bureau</li>
<li>Advise and brief senior bureau and agency leaders on issues related to the collection or analysis or Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program data</li>
<li>Serve as senior statistician within the bureau and provide statistical reviews and consultation for the application of quantitative methodologies in research projects and other analyses related to the application of Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program data to public health or epidemiological studies</li>
<li>Collaborate with other departmental agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, and other bureaus within the Health Resources and Services Administration such as the Bureau of Primary Health Care and the Office of Policy Evaluation and Analysis on the collection and analysis of Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program data in conjunction with other health care data to impact matters related to HIV across the country</li>
</ul>
<p>Selected Accomplishments:</p>
<ul>
<li>When I assumed the position of branch chief, the Division of Policy and Data had no staff with knowledge of data visualizations. I encouraged and mentored staff in the development of data visualization skills, and hired two interns to supplement our knowledge. I lead the interns and two statisticians in the creation of new and informative data visualizations utilizing for the first time Ryan White Services Report Data. Under this leadership, several data visualizations and graphics have been included as part of dissemination products to the public, for internal use only, for briefings of senior department officials, and for sharing with our stakeholders, to help supplement the story of the achievement of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.</li>
<li>The Ryan White Services Report is a new data set that the HIV/AIDS Bureau has only had for a few years. As the senior statistician in the HIV/AIDS Bureau, I have lead a team of mixed-scientific background including epidemiologists, biostatisticians, economists, nurses, and doctors, in the complex analysis of the Ryan White Services Report Data. This has included creative application of methods to analyze clinical outcomes and disparity analyses with adjustments for patient-factors and service provider-factors, creation of service provider performance benchmarks and goals, and other exploratory methods such as spatial statistics and association mining.</li>
<li>During the 2014 calendar year, the time lag between data collection and the publication of base analysis files and dissemination of data products was approximately 14 months for the Ryan White Services Report and the AIDS Drug Assistance Program Data Report. Under my leadership, I set aggressive goals and motivated the data management branch to reduce the time lag from 14 months in 2014 to approximately 9 months in 2015 and 4 months in 2016 by developing essential staff skills, championing the use of efficient database technologies, emphasizing the writing and maintenance of computer code that can be re-usable and generalized, effecting good project management practices and the development of master project schedules and requirements documents. This phenomenal improvement has allowed all data products to be disseminated on a more timely schedule.</li>
</ul>
