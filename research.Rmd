Welcome to my research and scholarship page! Below, you will find my research interests and links to project pages for my work. 

# Research Interests

My research applies theories and methods from the cognitive and learning sciences to investigate the act of learning and doing statistics, and critically examines statistics education research methodology. 

I am generally interested in research and scholarship in: 

- statistics education,
- cognitive sciences,
- learning sciences, 
- psychometrics, and
- history of statistics.
