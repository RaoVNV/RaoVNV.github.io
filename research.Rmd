# Interests

My work applies theories and methods from the cognitive and learning sciences to investigate the act of learning and doing statistics, and critically examines statistics education research theories and methodologies. 

Generally speaking, my work falls into one of two categories: 

- investigations of the cognitive processes underlying statistical thinking, and
- design-based educational research to develop new statistics pedagogies.

#### Interested in collaborating with me? 

As Dr. Joan Garfield once said, "I cannot imagine being a sole researcher on any project or keeping ideas to myself" (Garfield, 2013, p. 6)^[Garfield, J. (2013). Cooperative learning revisited: From an instructional method to a way of life. *Journal of Statistics Education, 21*(2).]. 

If you're a statistician looking for a psychologist, or a psychologist looking for a statistician, or generally interested in collaborating on research in statistical cognition or statistics education, I would love to set a time to chat with you. 

# Active Projects

<br> 

### Harnessing GPT Technologies to Develop Students' Statistical and Computational Thinking

What computational thinking skills are needed in order to successfully utilize generative AI applications to complete statistical and data related tasks? How can these technologies help broaden participation in STEM? For more, visit [link coming soon](). 

<br> 

### Building a Modern Assessment for Statistical Literacy

The [2016 GAISE Guidelines](https://www.amstat.org/docs/default-source/amstat-documents/gaisecollege_full.pdf) call for the incorporation of multivariable thinking into introductory statistics curricula. How can we measure the efficacy of curricula in developing these skills, and how can we measure students' multivariable thinking abilities? For more, visit [link coming soon]().

<br>

### Categorization of Statistical Measures

How do the *statistically significant* and *not statistically significant* category labels affect our cognition of statistical measures like *p*-values and Cohen's *d* effect sizes? For more, visit [RaoVNV.github.io/p-values/](/p-values/).

<br>

# Completed Projects

<br> 

### Human Clustering

How do humans cluster sets of points? Is their clustering reliable? What individual and group differences are there in human clustering? What other cognitive processes is clustering related to? For more, visit [RaoVNV.github.io/clustering/](/clustering/).

<br>

<!--

### Aesthetic Mappings

How do secondary teachers reason about aesthetic mappings linking complex data structures and modern data visualizations? For more, visit [RaoVNV.github.io/Data-to-Graphs/](/Data-to-Graphs/). 

<br>

### Biostatistical Literacy

What is biostatistical literacy, and how can we promote students' biostatistical literacy skills? For more, visit [RaoVNV.github.io/BiostatLiteracyProject](/BiostatLiteracyProject/).

<br>

### Gender Inclusivity

How should we incorporate and discuss gender as an attribute in datasets used in instruction and practice in STEM courses? For more, visit [https://raovnv.github.io/GenderInclusivity/](/GenderInclusivity/).

<br>

### Vedic Inspired Pedagogies

The Vedas and BhagavadGita contain essential lessons for all humanity. How can we borrow and apply pedagogical strategies from these timeless works to any subject we teach, including statistics? For more, visit [link coming soon]().



## Social Justice in Statistics

How can instructors incorporate social justice initiatives into statistics and data science classes? For more, visit [RaoVNV.github.io/SJinStats/](/SJinStats/). 

## Context in Statistics

How should instructors navigate context in statistics classes? For more, visit [RaoVNV.github.io/Contexts/](/Contexts/). 


# Values

## Scholarship

A major influence in my development as a researcher and scholar was a book discussing four models of scholarship beyond so-called traditional research^[Boyer, E. L. (1990). *Scholarship reconsidered: Priorities of the professoriate.* Princeton University Press: Lawrenceville, NJ.]. 

My own take on Boyer's ideas is that I want my research to incorporate both theory-generation as well as theory-application. Furthermore, as a statistics education professional, I want my work to include resources to support anyone who wants to use statistical tools, including researchers in other fields. 

While one may consider research as the generation of new knowledge, I do not hold knowledge as the ultimate prize. Whether or not the theory of gravity is true, it is *empowering* -- we can board an airplane and fly around the world. I want my work to be empowering, and as my focus is on statistics education, I want to empower individuals to be able to use statistics.

## Collaboration

My work heavily relies on interdisciplinary collaboration. As Dr. Joan Garfield once said, "I cannot imagine being a sole researcher on any project or keeping ideas to myself" (Garfield, 2013, p. 6)^[Garfield, J. (2013). Cooperative learning revisited: From an instructional method to a way of life. *Journal of Statistics Education, 21*(2).]. To wit, I founded a graduate student organizing called The Link Tank, whose aim is to connect people and ideas (find out more at [z.umn.edu/TheLinkTank](https://z.umn.edu/thelinktank)). You can also read more about my approach to research and scholarship in an article I wrote for SPARK magazine ('[From Happy Hour to Co-Author: How I Found an Academic Home](https://sparkezine.com/2021/04/04/from-happy-hour-to-co-author-how-i-found-an-academic-home/)').
