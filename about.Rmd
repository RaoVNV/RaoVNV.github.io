Welcome to my About Me page! Below, you will find my research, teaching, advising, and my CV. 

# Research 

My research investigates the psychology of statistics. That is, what does it mean to *do statistics* or *think statistically* and how does one learn how to do this. I am particularly interested in adapting methods utilized in the cognitive and learning sciences to the investigation of statistical thinking, and considering what new types of evidence can be observed and how this affects our theories of statistical cognition. 

My early milestone work utilized validity theory to evaluate how the *Comprehensive Assessment of Outcomes in Statistics* is utilized in statistics education research. Rao, Bye, and Varma (2021) borrowed methods from studies of categorical perception to examine the cognitive effects of categorizing *p*-values as "statistically significant" or not. DeLiema et al. (2021) examined how multi-model and multi-event video-based research can be utilized to arrive at new understandings of phenomena, including the study of statistics education. My dissertation examines graduate students' understanding of null models, and how this understanding may be intertwined with the software being used. It also explores how traces of an individuals' thinking such as eye-tracking can support inferences about an individual's cognition and support tasks like as observations and think-aloud interviews.
