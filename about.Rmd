Welcome to my About Me page! Below, you will find information about my research, teaching, advising, and my CV. 

# Research 

My research investigates the psychology of statistics. That is, what does it mean to do statistics or think statistically, and how does one learn to do this? I draw on theories and methods from the cognitive and learning sciences to investigate statistical thinking, and consider what new types of evidence we might observe and how this affects our theories of statistical cognition.

# Teaching

आचार्यात् पादमादत्ते पादं शिष्यः स्वमेधया। सब्रह्मचारिभ्यः पादं पादं कालक्रमेण च॥ *Mahabharata 5:44:9*

This saying states that a student’s learning is derived from four sources: their teacher, themselves, their peers, and through time. These four sources do not operate independently - my choices as a teacher are inexorably intertwined with the impact each source has on students. My goal is thus to support my students’ learning by facilitating a learning environment in which all sources can contribute to students’ growth. To manifest these values in a learning environment, I adopt a student-centered approach to guide my student interactions and classroom presence.

# Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion

நான் யார்? [naan yaar] In Tamil, this question famously asked by the Saint Sri Ramana Maharishi simply asks, “Who am I?”. The answer might best be expressed by the great saying from the Yajur Veda, अहम् ब्रह्मास्मि [aham brahmaasmi], meaning “I am Brahman”. Brahman, in the advaita (non-dualistic) tradition, is the infinite all-pervading consciousness without which there is nothing, what we might call ‘The Holy Spirit’ or ‘God’. This seemingly simple question and answer, asking us to see God in everything and everyone, are at the core of my beliefs, and govern the way I interact with all others, whether they be students, colleagues, friends, or family. I strive to see a oneness in all creation and in the omnipresence of variability in that creation, and use my skills to support and empower my fellow living beings however I can.
